# Provider API

RecallGraph exports all its HTTP API methods as providers. This lets other Foxx services declare a dependency on RecallGraph, after which they can directly invoke its exported API methods. For more information, see the relevant section in [ArangoDB Docs](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/foxx-guides-dependencies.html).

The API documentation for the exported providers is linked below:
